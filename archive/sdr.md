# Sales Development Representative (SDR) at [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/)
> $4,200+/month on target earnings, part-time contract

If you're a stellar communicator and go-getter who wants to join a quickly growing service business in the tech industry, this role could be a great way to advance your sales career.

As a Sales Development Representative at Draft.dev, you'll help us generate high-quality leads and book sales calls with key decision-makers. You’ll work closely with our Account Director and Marketing team to manage outreach sequences, update prospect data, and research potential prospects. 

Unlike traditional SDR roles that rely on high-volume cold outreach, this position is focused on quality over quantity. You'll be targeting strategic, high-value prospects with personalized messaging tailored to their roles, challenges, and industry trends. Your goal is to initiate meaningful conversations—not just book meetings—by providing useful insights and positioning our solution as valuable and relevant. Through thoughtful engagement and timely follow-ups, you’ll help ensure we stay top of mind with decision-makers so that when they’re ready to evaluate a partner, we’re the first call they make.
